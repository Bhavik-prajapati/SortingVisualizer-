# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

# SortingVisualizer-
SortingVisualizer is a web application built with React that allows users to select a sorting algorithm and visualize how it works on a set of randomly generated data. It is hosted on GitHub, making it easy for anyone to contribute to the project.

SortingVisualizer is a powerful web application developed using React that offers a unique and interactive way to learn and explore various sorting algorithms. By visualizing the process of sorting a randomly generated set of data, users can witness the inner workings of popular algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quicksort, and mergesort.

The project is ideal for developers who want to gain hands-on experience with DSA concepts, or for anyone interested in the visual representation of sorting algorithms. The intuitive user interface allows users to select and customize the algorithm, adjust the speed of the sorting animation, and change the size of the data set. The application provides an immersive experience that makes it easier to understand how sorting algorithms operate, making it an excellent learning tool.

The SortingVisualizer project is designed with readability and extendability in mind, making it easy to understand the code and build on the existing functionality. The code is well-organized, well-documented, and adheres to industry best practices, which ensures that it is maintainable and scalable.

The project is hosted on GitHub, making it accessible to anyone who wants to contribute to the project. The repository includes all the necessary files and documentation to get started with the project, including instructions on how to run the project locally. It is an open-source project, so developers can learn from the codebase and make their contributions to improve the project.

Overall, SortingVisualizer is an excellent educational tool for anyone interested in sorting algorithms or DSA concepts. It provides a comprehensive, interactive experience that helps users to learn and explore sorting algorithms with ease. The well-organized code and open-source nature of the project make it a valuable resource for developers who want to learn and contribute to the development community.
